## Environment Setup for Students Using Mac Computers
Let's go ahead and get your environment setup. Don't worry too much about the how's and why's of all of this. Our goal is to get you up and running as fast as possible!

##1. Download and Install Google Chrome

https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/

##2. Make Sure You Have Xcode

Type `xcode-select --install` into your terminal. If a window pops up telling you to install Xcode agree to the terms and follow the instructions.

##3. Download Homebrew

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/.). is an awesome package manager, and makes downloading lots of software really easy. Download Homebrew by entering
```
  ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Once downloading is complete, you'll want to enter `brew doctor` to make sure you don't have any conflicts.

##4. Get the Most Updated Version of Git.

Update your version of git by entering `brew install git`

If you have issues with Homebrew, You can try reinstalling it with this command:
```
\curl -L https://gist.github.com/mxcl/1173223/raw/a833ba44e7be8428d877e58640720ff43c59dbad/uninstall_homebrew.sh | bash
```

##5. Set Up a Sublime Sym Link

This means that instead of typing `open` to open files, you can type `subl` and it will open that file in Sublime Text. Programmers love shortcuts and this one is super helpful.

#### For Sublime Text 2
```
ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin
```

#### For Sublime Text 3
```
ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin
```

##6. Set Up Your `.bash_profile`.

We'll spend a lot more time in terminal today, but it's helpful if your `.bash_profile` looks just like mine. We're going to open terminal and enter the following commands:

`cd ~`

`ls -lah`

This command should bring up a list of all the files on your computer, including secret hidden files that begin with a `.`. We're looking for a file called `.bash_profile`.
If it's there go ahead and enter `open .bash_profile`.
It it's not there, enter `touch .bash_profile` followed by `open .bash_profile`.

We're going to use the standard for ours. Copy and paste this code below into your `.bash_profile` and save it.

```bash
# Configuring Our Prompt
# ======================

  # if you install git via homebrew, or install the bash autocompletion via homebrew, you get __git_ps1 which you can use in the PS1
  # to display the git branch.  it's supposedly a bit faster and cleaner than manually parsing through sed. i dont' know if you care
  # enough to change it

  # This function is called in your prompt to output your active git branch.
  function parse_git_branch {
    git branch --no-color 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/'
  }

  # This function builds your prompt. It is called below
  function prompt {
    # Define some local colors
    local         RED="\[\033[0;31m\]" # This syntax is some weird bash color thing I never
    local   LIGHT_RED="\[\033[1;31m\]" # really understood
    local        CHAR="♥"
    local   BLUE="\[\e[0;49;34m\]"

    # ♥ ☆ - Keeping some cool ASCII Characters for reference

    # Here is where we actually export the PS1 Variable which stores the text for your prompt
    export PS1="\[\e]2;\u@\h\a[\[\e[37;44;1m\]\t\[\e[0m\]]$RED\$(parse_git_branch) \[\e[32m\]\W\[\e[0m\]\n\[\e[0;31m\]$BLUE//$RED $CHAR \[\e[0m\]"
      PS2='> '
      PS4='+ '
    }

  # Finally call the function and our prompt is all pretty
  prompt

  # For more prompt coolness, check out Halloween Bash:
  # http://xta.github.io/HalloweenBash/

  # If you break your prompt, just delete the last thing you did.
  # And that's why it's good to keep your dotfiles in git too.

# Environment Variables
# =====================
  # Library Paths
  # These variables tell your shell where they can find certain
  # required libraries so other programs can reliably call the variable name
  # instead of a hardcoded path.

    # NODE_PATH
    # Node Path from Homebrew I believe
    export NODE_PATH="/usr/local/lib/node_modules:$NODE_PATH"

    # Those NODE & Python Paths won't break anything even if you
    # don't have NODE or Python installed. Eventually you will and
    # then you don't have to update your bash_profile

  # Configurations

    # GIT_MERGE_AUTO_EDIT
    # This variable configures git to not require a message when you merge.
    export GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT='no'

    # Editors
    # Tells your shell that when a program requires various editors, use sublime.
    # The -w flag tells your shell to wait until sublime exits
    export VISUAL="subl -w"
    export SVN_EDITOR="subl -w"
    export GIT_EDITOR="subl -w"
    export EDITOR="subl -w"

  # Paths

    # The USR_PATHS variable will just store all relevant /usr paths for easier usage
    # Each path is seperate via a : and we always use absolute paths.

    # A bit about the /usr directory
    # The /usr directory is a convention from linux that creates a common place to put
    # files and executables that the entire system needs access too. It tries to be user
    # independent, so whichever user is logged in should have permissions to the /usr directory.
    # We call that /usr/local. Within /usr/local, there is a bin directory for actually
    # storing the binaries (programs) that our system would want.
    # Also, Homebrew adopts this convetion so things installed via Homebrew
    # get symlinked into /usr/local
    export USR_PATHS="/usr/local:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin"

    # Hint: You can interpolate a variable into a string by using the $VARIABLE notation as below.

    # We build our final PATH by combining the variables defined above
    # along with any previous values in the PATH variable.

    # Our PATH variable is special and very important. Whenever we type a command into our shell,
    # it will try to find that command within a directory that is defined in our PATH.
    # Read http://blog.seldomatt.com/blog/2012/10/08/bash-and-the-one-true-path/ for more on that.
    export PATH="$USR_PATHS:$PATH"

    # If you go into your shell and type: $PATH you will see the output of your current path.
    # For example, mine is:
    # /Users/avi/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p392/bin:/Users/avi/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p392@global/bin:/Users/avi/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p392/bin:/Users/avi/.rvm/bin:/usr/local:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:/usr/local/share/python:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:

## Congrats!

Phew! That was a lot of work, but now you are all set.
